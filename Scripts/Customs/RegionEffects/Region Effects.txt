        Have You ever wanted Cold Effects for Ice Dungeon or Fire Effects for Fire Dungeon or to have them in some other region (maybe just for an event)? There are 11 Effects in all:
        Dark
        Fire
        Ice
        Toxic
        Electric
        Water
        Mist
        Explosion
        Stoned
        Shiney
        Firefly

        Place the effects stone somewhere out of the way, double click (As A GM or higher) then set the effects for the regions you want and the torment for players begins.

        GoldDraco13 originally wrote this. It been changed a few times but I never liked that it couldn't be accessed from other scripts. It now can.

        I have added Earring that Void the all the Effects (there's a reward version of the same item name in the Vet Rewards Upgrade package I released) the ones here are NOT a reward item.

        You can edit the duration or amount of damage in EffectsSystem.cs (At about line 12470).
